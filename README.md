# JavaMarket
Platform for supermarkets to keep track of product departments, items, customers, with Swing-based user interface and a notification system based on the Observer design pattern. Singleton, Iterator, Visitor, Builder and Strategy patterns are also present throughout the implementation.

Use the pre-built test files to run some interface examples with the TestInterface file. The interface will guide you to select the required files and will display warning messages if errors occur.

You may also run the Test file, a cli version of the app. It requires the test files to be already present in the main folder of the Java project.
